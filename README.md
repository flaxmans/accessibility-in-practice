# accessibility-in-practice
This git repository contains files I used to give a presentation on making PowerPoint presentations accessible for students who use screen readers to get information out of these presentations.

## Files in this Repository
1. A PowerPoint Presentation I used to introduce the concept of Accessibility: "AccessibilityPresentation.pptx"
2. A PowerPoint template I use for making PowerPoint Presentations that meet accessibility guidelines: "UniversalDesignSlides.potx".  See the demo (next) and "How to use..." (below) for how to create and use PowerPoint Templates

## Demo of creating accessibile PowerPoint presentations and your own Templates:
To see a demo, please check out this YouTube video I made as a screencast of a presentation I gave in the EBIO "Brown Bag" series on 12/7/16.  The ideas of Universal Design, common accessibility problems with PowerPoint, and how to overcome these problems are explained here: <https://youtu.be/L_L5E8Y9hJo>

## How to use the PowerPoint template
1. Download the template ("UniversalDesignSlides.potx") to a folder on your computer
2. Use PowerPoint to open the Template file
3. Choose "Save As..." from the File menu
4. Make sure the "Format" is still "PowerPoint Template (.potx)" (this is selected in a drop-down menu in the Save As dialogue window)
5. Save it to the "My Templates" folder.  This should be the default location to save it.  If, for some reason, that is not the default folder, see below (this is kind of a pain because the folder is "hidden" on most systems that I know of).
6. You can quit PowerPoint now.  
7. Any time you create a new Presentation, you can start PowerPoint normally, and once it starts, choose "New from Template" in the File menu.  The template you saved to "My Templates" should be visible in the dialogue windows that follow.

#### Optional info: Finding the "My Templates" folder on a Mac:
1. In a Finder window, navigate to Applications > Utilities
2. Double-click on "Terminal.app"
3. Copy and paste the following to the command line in Terminal and press enter/return:  
```
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Microsoft/Office/User\ Templates/My\ Templates/
``` 
<br>
4. That should open a finder window where you can drag-and-drop the template file from any other location (where you downloaded it the first place, above)

###### If anyone knows how to find "My Templates" on a Windows machine, please let me know!
