# accessibility-in-practice
This git repository contains files I used to give a presentation on making PowerPoint presentations accessible for students who use screen readers to get information out of these presentations.

## Explanation and a demo:
The ideas of Universal Design, common accessibility problems with PowerPoint, and how to overcome these problems are explained in a YouTube video screencast I made on 12/7/16 <https://youtu.be/L_L5E8Y9hJo>

## How to use the PowerPoint template
1. Download the template to a folder on your computer
2. Use PowerPoint to open the Template file
3. Choose "Save As..." from the File menu
4. Make sure the "type" is still "PowerPoint Template (.potx)"
5. Save it to the "My Templates" folder.  This should be the default location to save it.
6. You can quit PowerPoint now.  Any time you create a new Presentation, you can start PowerPoint normally, and once it starts, choose "New Presentation From Template"
7. The template you just saved to "My Templates" should be visible in the dialogue windows that follow
